            <h2>5 Common Whirlpool Freezer Problems We Fix</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="content-container">
          <div class="full-width-content">
            <h3>1. Warm interior or thawing food</h3>
            <p>When your Whirlpool freezer starts losing its chill, the culprit is often dirty condenser coils or a faulty thermostat. These parts regulate cooling, and if they're clogged or malfunctioning, your freezer can't hold the cold—putting your groceries at risk.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Freezer runs nonstop but doesn't cool</h3>
            <p>If your unit is making noise and running constantly without actually freezing, it might be struggling with a weak start relay or a low refrigerant charge. This puts unnecessary strain on the compressor and spikes your energy bills without doing its job.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Frost building up inside the cabinet</h3>
            <p>Thick ice on the walls, shelves, or around the gasket is a sign your defrost system may be failing. Torn door gaskets or burned-out defrost heaters allow moisture to creep in and freeze, leading to airflow blockages and inconsistent temperatures.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Clicking or buzzing sounds</h3>
            <p>A loud click or continuous buzzing sound usually means the relay is trying—and failing—to start the compressor. This is often the first sign of a failing compressor or relay overload kit and should be addressed before the freezer stops working entirely.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Ice-maker leaks or overflows</h3>
            <p>If your Whirlpool freezer has a built-in ice maker that's dripping or flooding the bin, the problem might be a leaky water inlet valve or a frozen fill tube. These issues can cause puddles, ice clumps, or even damage to surrounding components if not repaired promptly.</p>

              <AccordionItem title="How long does a Whirlpool compressor replacement take?">
                <p>About 2–3 hours including full refrigerant recharge.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Are OEM parts required for warranty coverage?">
                <p>Yes. We use genuine Whirlpool parts to keep your warranty valid.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Do you offer weekend appointments?">
                <p>Yes, Saturday service is available from 8 AM to 4 PM at no extra charge.</p>

              <AccordionItem title="Can I get a quote before the visit?">
                <p>Absolutely. Text or email a photo of your model/serial tag for a same-day estimate.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Why should I schedule regular maintenance for my Whirlpool appliances?">
                <p>Routine tune-ups catch worn parts, dirty coils, or loose wiring before they trigger a costly failure, extending each unit's life and keeping warranty coverage intact. A well-maintained appliance also runs more efficiently, lowering utility bills and shrinking your carbon footprint.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="How does preventive maintenance reduce breakdowns?">
                <p>Technicians inspect belts, filters, seals, sensors, and control boards for early wear. Replacing a $25 start-relay or cleaning a clogged condenser coil now can save hundreds on a future compressor or control-board replacement—and prevent food loss or downtime.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Will maintenance really make my Whirlpool freezer, fridge, or washer last longer?">
                <p>Yes. Clean coils, calibrated thermostats, and tight gaskets let compressors and motors run cooler, putting less stress on critical components. Many Whirlpool appliances that receive annual service outperform their expected lifespan by three to five years.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Can regular service lower my energy bills?">
                <p>Absolutely. A refrigerator with dust-free condenser coils can use up to 15 percent less electricity, while a dryer with a clear vent shortens cycle times. Over a year, those efficiency gains translate into noticeable savings on your power bill.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Is maintenance important for safety as well as performance?">
                <p>It is. A professional inspection uncovers frayed power cords, overheating elements, slow gas leaks, and other hazards long before they become fire or health risks—protecting your home and family while keeping the appliance performing at its best.</p>
              </AccordionItem>
              
              <AccordionItem title="Is regular maintenance really necessary?">
                <p>Yes. Clean coils, tight gaskets, and healthy fans reduce stress on components, extend appliance life, and cut down energy bills.</p>
